"""
behaviors.fleet — the behaviour rules that watch a tram / fleet-network twin.

Three-tier stack, same contract as the rest of the platform:

  * Tier A (physics)  — NetworkFlowResidual: achieved commercial speed vs what
                        the timetable physics predicts from demand/signalling —
                        the earliest hidden-congestion / blockage signal.
                        TractionEnergyResidual: measured traction draw vs the
                        physics prediction — catches OHL leakage / arcing and
                        regen loss before voltage or substations trip.
  * Tier C (rules)    — hard-limit monitors: OTP, headway adherence, OHL
                        undervoltage, substation overload, rail temperature
                        (buckling), bogie vibration (wheel flats), brake and
                        pantograph wear, door/signal fault counts, fleet
                        availability, accumulated network delay.

`build_fleet_registry()` returns exactly these behaviours, used by both the
live engine and the forward predictor.
